# network-targeted-protection-
Targeted protection by identifying critical nodes in complex networks.
T = Target nodes, K = Linkage nodes which are directly connected to target nodes, R = Remaining nodes which are directly linked with K nodes and are connected among other R nodes.
Critical R(graph coloring) and Critical R are subset of R.
